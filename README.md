-----------------A brief explanation of your approach and challenges faced (if any).-------------------

For this task, I used Next.js as the framework along with Shadcn for UI components and TanStack Query and TanStack Table for data fetching and table management. This was my first time working with TanStack Table and TanStack Query, which took a few hours to learn. I was able to quickly grasp their concepts and apply them effectively, demonstrating my ability to learn new technologies and implement them efficiently.

One of the main challenges I faced was related to integrating Shadcn-UI with TanStack Query. I encountered errors when trying to use TanStack Query on the server side while also working with client-side components, which led to issues with data fetching. After researching and troubleshooting, I was able to resolve the errors with the help of Stack Overflow, which I have used since my college days to solve similar issues. This experience helped me further develop my problem-solving skills and my ability to troubleshoot effectively.

Overall, the task allowed me to demonstrate my ability to learn and apply new tools, while also tackling challenges that required persistence and effective use of resources.
